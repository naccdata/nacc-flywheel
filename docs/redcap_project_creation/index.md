# REDCap Project Creation

Each project in the form ingest pipeline for a study/center in Flywheel has an associated REDCap project at NACC REDCap instance (for the centers who are going to use direct data entry submission option). This gear uses the REDCap API to automate creation of these REDCap projects.

Gear uses a REDCap super user token to create the necessary projects in REDCap. It updates the AWS parameter store with the API tokens for the newly created projects and adds the mapping information to the respective study/centers metadata projects in Flywheel. 

### Environment
This gear uses the AWS SSM parameter store, and expects that AWS credentials are available in environment variables (`AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION`) within the Flywheel runtime.

### Inputs
YAML file with the details on the REDCap projects to be created for each stydy/center.

```yaml

  - sample-center
  - example-center
